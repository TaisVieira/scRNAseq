### These lines identify one of the distict populations that was seen on the PCA graphs

#isolates the population
pop <- subset(pca_df, PC1>-1 & PC1<3.5)   
pop <- subset(pop, PC2>-3 & 3>PC2)

#plot the isolate to make sure it's correct
ggplot(pop, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=stages)) + geom_point(alpha=0.4) + labs(title="pop", x=percentage[1], y=percentage[2])

#gets the barcode from the cells in that population and uses only those cells to create a ranking list of their most expressed genes
pop_bc <- pop$barcode
pop_exp <- merged_full_table[which(merged_full_table$barccodes %in% pop_bc),]
exp<-sort(colSums(pop_exp[,1:5192]),decreasing=TRUE)
